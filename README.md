# nrf52-ses-template
A Segger Embedded Studio project template for building outside the Nordic SDK directory
This only contains the project for the NRF52840-DK development kit.

It is based on the UART example from the SDK.

1. Set up the global macro `$(SDKDir)` in segger to point to the root of your Nordic SDK.
2. Put your project wherever you want
